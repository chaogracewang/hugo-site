# About Me 

[Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/emallickhossain/HossainCV/blob/master/HossainCV.pdf)

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania interested in inequality, consumer behavior, and industrial organization. My research focuses on how bulk discounts increase inequality. Previously, I have explored the effects of sales tax collection on online shopping.

During 2015-2016, I worked as a Staff Economist for the Council of Economic Advisers. I helped identify and analyze important macroeconomic trends in growth, productivity, and labor force participation and kept the President abreast of economic developments. I also worked on retirement and personal finance issues, such as the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Conflict of Interest Rule. As an undergraduate at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, I obtained Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and a Bachelor’s degree in Philosophy, in addition to completing a pre-medical curriculum. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a White House Intern with the National Economic Council which gave me critical insight and experience with the policymaking process.

My extensive experiences and academic background enables me to span the fields of economics, retirement, medicine, and ethics as well as having skills in both research and policymaking.
