The National Board of Medical Examiners is responsible for designing and administering the US Medical Licensing Exam, which is a series of tests that medical students take in order to obtain their medical license. The interesting feature is that they are designated as a non-profit even though they do seem to behave in a profit-maximizing fashion. One could basically visualize them as a firm that produces a single good, the USMLE exam and then prices it. 

Before we dig too deep, let's look at their basic revenues and costs as well as the revenue breakdown.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(plotly)
library(httr)
nbme <- GET("https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/api/v2/organizations/231352238.json")
apple <- content(nbme)
pear <- as.data.table(t(apple$filings_with_data))
```
